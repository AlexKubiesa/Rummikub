# Rummikub

Occasionally in Rummikub, one player will pick up a lot of tiles without being able to place any down and hit the 30-point threshold for an initial meld. This project calculates the probability of not being able to form an initial meld, depending on the number of tiles the player has drawn.

Note: The calculation assumes that jokers are not used in the initial meld.
